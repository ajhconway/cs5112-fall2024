# Syllabus for CS 5112

Welcome to CS 5112, Algorithms for Applications. This class covers fundamental
algorithms and data structures used in current applications.  Algorithms include
graph algorithms, hashing and streaming/sketching techniques. Applications will
include select topics in machine learning, systems, security, and more.

Classroom: Bloomberg Center 131

Lecture time: 1:25pm-2:40pm Tuesday/Thursday

Instructors: 

Alex Conway (https://ajhconway.com/) and Tom Ristenpart (https://rist.tech.cornell.edu)

Office hours: TBA

TAs: 
Yash Akhauri (ya255@cornell.edu),
Justin Chiu (jtc257@cornell.edu), Carolina Ortega Perez (co255@cornell.edu), 
Subham Sahoo (sss284@cornell.edu)

TA Office hours: TBA. You may also join the #office-hours channel on Slack for virtual OH and expect TA response in 24h.

You will be invited to a class slack, which we will use for announcements, Q&A,
etc.  Contact Carolina if you are having trouble getting onto it.

### Pre-requisites

Familiarity with basic programming, algorithms, and data structures (at the
level taught in a sophomore course), or permission of instructor.  

### Requirements

The class will involve a combination of lectures, and the primary deliverable
will be homeworks that combine programming and short answers. Homeworks 
and homeworks. You'll be graded according to the following:

* Participation: 10%
* Homeworks:  90% (each homework will count an equal amount)

**Late Days.** Homeworks are due on the due date by 11:59:59pm EST. You can
use in total 3 late days throughout the semester.

There will be several opportunities for extra credit, as well. The current plan
is to have four or five homework assignments spread across the semester. Details and
schedule will be released in the first week of class. 

We will allow students to collaborate on homeworks, but each individual must
submit their own solutions written up individually. Homeworks should indicate
who you collaborated with. Similarly, any online sources or tools (such as code
generation tools) you utilize should be explicitly acknowledged. While we do not
prohibit using such tools, you are of course responsible for the correctness of
submitted solutions, and we expect you to understand them and be able to explain
them. 

We expect students to attend lectures. We have reserved 10\% of final grades as 
participation; the default will be that everyone gets the full 10\% but we
reserve the right to start taking attendance or otherwise change how
participation is alotted if lecture attendance/participation proves poor. We
 


### Background reading and Lecture note

While no textbook is required, we will be basing a lot of content on the [Kleinberg and Tardos textbook](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/algorithm-design/P200000003259/9780137546350).
